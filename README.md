## Introduction

Face and eye detection is a fundamental task in computer vision. OpenCV is a popular open-source computer vision library that provides tools for face and eye detection. This project serves as a starting point for those looking to perform face and eye detection using OpenCV.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this project, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.5 or higher
- OpenCV (cv2) Python library
- NumPy Python library

You can install OpenCV and NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
```

## Installation

To get started with this project, you can simply clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Face-and-Eye-Detection-using-OpenCV.git
cd Face-and-Eye-Detection-using-OpenCV
```

## Usage

You can use the provided script `face_and_eye_detection.py` to detect faces and eyes in images and video streams. Here's how to use it:

```bash
python face_and_eye_detection.py --input input_file
```

- `input_file` should be the path to the image or video file you want to perform face and eye detection on.

Example:

```bash
python face_and_eye_detection.py --input input_image.jpg
```

The script will display the output with rectangles drawn around detected faces and eyes.

## Demo

You can find a demonstration of how to use this project in the `demo` folder. The demo includes sample images and a video for testing the face and eye detection.
